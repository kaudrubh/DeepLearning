# Machine Learning Model for Classification

## Overview
This project implements machine learning models to perform classification on the Breast Cancer dataset. The models used include a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier from `scikit-learn` and a neural network built using `TensorFlow/Keras`.

## Requirements
The following Python libraries are required to run this project:
- `numpy`
- `math`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow`

You can install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset**, which is available in `scikit-learn` via `load_breast_cancer()`.

## Features Implemented
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
- Standardizing features using `StandardScaler`
- Implementing a Multi-Layer Perceptron classifier using `scikit-learn`
- Building a neural network using `TensorFlow/Keras`
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy score and classification reports
- Visualizing results using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

## Usage
Run the Python script to:
1. Load the dataset
2. Preprocess and split the data
3. Train and evaluate MLP and TensorFlow/Keras models
4. Display accuracy and loss metrics

To execute the script, run:
```bash
python your_script.py
```

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated using:
- **Accuracy Score**: Measures the number of correct predictions.
- **Log Loss**: Evaluates classification performance.
- **Classification Report**: Provides precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Visualization
The script includes visualization tools to:
- Plot decision boundaries
- Display model performance trends

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute by optimizing the model, adding new visualizations, or experimenting with different neural network architectures.
